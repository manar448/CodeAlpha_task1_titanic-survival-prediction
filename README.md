# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## Overview 📊

The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including their age, gender, class, and whether they survived.

## Project Overview 🎯

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the factors influencing survival.
- Build predictive models to classify whether a passenger survived based on their attributes.
- Evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms.

## Data Sources 📂

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It includes the following features:

- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Name`: Name of the passenger
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `Age`: Age of the passenger
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Fare paid by the passenger
- `Cabin`: Cabin number
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Objectives 🎯

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models for predicting survival.
- Visualize the results to communicate findings effectively.

## Tools and Techniques 🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines

## Analysis Highlights 📈

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of survival rates among different demographics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the accuracy of various machine learning models.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which features contribute most to survival predictions.
